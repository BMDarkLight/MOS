# M Edition
This Project is NOT Complete. and it seems like it is never going to be complete.
This is more like a time capsule into the past for me than a real project. It is fun to wonder around it or to even run it. I wrote this whole thing back when i was 12 years old so ... Have fun!

# About Of M Edition
M Edition is a project which aims to simulate an entire operating system running under a web server and as a web application.
It has capabilities like installing specific packages, running executable files, having dedicated yet basic user segmentation system, having a little programming language called "e" which is basically OOP PHP but used in certain circumstances and it is not complete OFC.
It has a shitty UI, i was never a front-end guy.
It has a terminal and some sort of package manager and a UI Store front AND some "ONLINE" services like "M Live" and "M Games" which none of them work now because the server actually handling the repository for this stuff is long gone and there no plan to bring it back :)

Overall it had potential.
